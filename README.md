## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps to Understand the cost of living is crucial for individuals, businesses, and policymakers to make informed decisions about financial planning, investment, and policy formulation. 
The cost of living varies significantly across regions due to differences in housing prices, food costs, transportation expenses, healthcare costs, education expenses, income levels, and other socioeconomic factors.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.  
- Step 5 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 6 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for six fields
- Step 7 : Two map visuals were added to the canvas, one representing local purchasing power by country & cost of living plus rent by country.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used.
